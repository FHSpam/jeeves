TODO
(improvements)


- Command Deploy :
  - When command fails, identify if:
       - things will be ok if 
       - if a manual intervention is required
    and display this to user
  - Handle several files
      E.g.: $ Nestor deploy -R fhibox1 -r 50822 /my/www/fic1 /my/www/fic2
  - Handle several files with different revisions
      E.g.: $ Nestor deploy -e prod -R fhibox1 -m 'message' /my/www/fic1:50822 /my/www/fic2:50814
  - Deploy from description file
      E.g.: $ Nestor deploy -f ./mep_projet_20789.txt

  - Log all infos about deploy, in DB
  - Test mode
  - After deploy, run monitoring script to check that everything is OK
  - Before deploy, run unit/integration tests if they exist and only deploy if they pass
  - See command help

- Command compare :
  - Handle case when target file is a dir
  - See command help

- Command more (previously seefile):
  - connect to AWS to know the private IPs of all instances in ASG (=> install AWS CLI)
  - add an option for grep (instead of piping to grep)
  
- Command rollback : rollback a deploy that's been done (finished and successfu)
  E.g. undo the last deploy
  - todo completely

- All commands :
  - i18n
  - Non interactive mode
  - Create a metacommand class (stack of commandes) that itself behaves like a Command
    that can be executed, rollbacked (would call rollback on every subcommand of the stack)
  - Rollback : improve
     - Every command (ex. deploy) (which is a succession of shell commands), 
       should be atomic and should be rollback-able
       => define as a metacommand with a command stack, each having a rollback (see above)
     - Rollback should be a command in and out of itself. A rollback may indeed fail e and 
	   we'd want the user to know about that

  - In all commands use printf rather than echo (more portable)
  - Allow user to input multiple values on prompt, when option value is not passed, and when option accepts multiple values (see OptionOrArgument->handleDefault())
  - Help formatting looks like sh*t when help message
    - on one line and too long
    - on several lines

- Instruction.php
  not systematically display message - sometimes Failure can be normal

PROJECT INFO

Composer update :

Francois hill@Fhibox-PC-2 /cygdrive/c/Users/Francois hill/Documents/WORK/FRONT/my/work/scripts_2/lib
$ php composer.phar update

PhpUnit :
Since we're working to be compatible with the version of PHP installed on our servers (PHP 5.3 ...)
we have to use a compatible version of PHPUnit.
=> downloading the latest phar from PHPUnit's website won't do it.
=> we'll get a specific version through Composer.
