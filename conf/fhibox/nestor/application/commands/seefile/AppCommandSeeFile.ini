Display a file (source or log) from the production environment


Examples:
---------
- Display a log file from production, iterating on all production servers:
  $ Nestor more /my/www/booking_saas_all_business/booking_card2/core/app/logs/prod.log
 
- Same, displaying only last 100 lines:
  $ Nestor more -l 100 /my/www/booking_saas_all_business/booking_card2/core/app/logs/prod.log

- Send 100 last lines by email:
  $ Nestor more -l 100 -m francois.hill@fhibox.com /my/logs/slurps_metacall/log_metacall_booking.txt

- Look for a particular pattern on every server, in last 500 lines, and mail results:
  (using option -g to look for a pattern should actually be preferred)
  $ Nestor more -l 500 /my/logs/slurps_metacall/log_metacall_booking.txt  | grep -C 10 \"merchant_id : 20\" | mail -s "logs metacall" francois.hill@fhibox.com

- Pattern lookup with option -g :
  $ Nestor more -g "2016-01-13 21" /my/www/booking_saas_all_business/booking_card2/core/app/logs/prod.log

- Display apache log (restrictions may apply) :
  $ Nestor more /var/log/apache2/error.log

- Display sync/deploy mecanism logs :
  $ Nestor more /var/log/deploy_pull/deploy_pull.log


Troubleshooting/Notes:
----------------------
- Displayal of a file is always subject to its accessibility in terms of rights (Read)
  on servers, granted to user issuing the present command.
- If not getting mails, this may be due to a to vast quantity of material sent (too many lines
  or lines too long)
